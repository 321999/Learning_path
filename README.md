Learning Path App
An app for the Learning Path with frontend and backend sections:

Frontend:

Create the following features for a simple Learning Path app's frontend:

Make a homepage that gives a brief description of the app and lists its featured learning paths and roadmaps.

Display a list of learning paths, each of which represents a structured curriculum for a particular subject or competency. Each learning path's title, summary, and image should be displayed.
Implement individual roadmap pages that detail the steps to take in order to learn a particular skill or accomplish a particular objective. Include thorough directions, suggested readings, and completion dates for each step.
Create a section on how to study and learn that provides pointers, tricks, and best practices for efficient study and learning. To help users improve their learning experience, include articles, videos, or interactive content.
Users should be able to monitor their progress within learning pathways or roadmaps. To keep users motivated, display completed tasks, ongoing tasks, and overall progress indicators.

Backend:
Create a Learning Path app backend with the following capabilities:
Data management: Create a database to keep track of user progress, learning paths, and roadmaps. Create useful schemas to efficiently organize and store the data.
Create CRUD operations for learning paths, roadmaps, and user progress using RESTful API endpoints. Create endpoints that can be used to create, read, update, and delete entities.
Implement an admin dashboard so that users with the necessary permissions can control learning paths and roadmaps. Allow for the creation, updating, and deletion of paths and roadmaps.
Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users (such as administrators) can access the admin dashboard and carry out administrative tasks.
Implement API endpoints to retrieve user progress, learning paths, and roadmaps. Allow sorting and filtering options to improve user experience.
Provide detailed and understandable documentation for the backend API, detailing each endpoint's requirements for request payloads and expected responses.


Users of this straightforward Learning Path app can explore structured learning paths, adhere to thorough road maps, and access resources to improve their learning journey. For authorized users to create and manage learning paths and roadmaps, the backend includes an admin dashboard. Once the core functionalities are in place, additional features, such as user profiles, community interaction, or gamification components, can be added as upgrades.
