# Learning Path

A learning path, also known as a learning journey or curriculum, is a structured and progressive roadmap designed to guide individuals through the process of acquiring knowledge and skills in a specific subject or domain. It outlines the essential topics, concepts, and resources necessary for learners to achieve their learning goals.

## Features

4. Recommended Resources: Learning paths often include a curated list of recommended resources, such as books, articles, tutorials, videos, online courses, or practical exercises.

5. Flexibility: While there is a suggested order, learners can often choose to skip certain sections or revisit previous topics based on their needs and prior knowledge.

6. Real-world Applications: Learning paths may include practical exercises or projects to apply newly acquired knowledge and skills.
